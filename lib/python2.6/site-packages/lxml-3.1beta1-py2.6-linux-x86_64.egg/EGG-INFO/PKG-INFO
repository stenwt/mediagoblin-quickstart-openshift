Description: lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It
        provides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree
        API.
        
        It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
        RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.
        
        To contact the project, go to the `project home page
        <http://lxml.de/>`_ or see our bug tracker at
        https://launchpad.net/lxml
        
        In case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml,
        you can get it from the github repository at
        https://github.com/lxml/lxml .  Note that this requires Cython to
        build the sources, see the build instructions on the project home
        page.  To the same end, running ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will
        install lxml from
        https://github.com/lxml/lxml/tarball/master#egg=lxml-dev if you have
        an appropriate version of Cython installed.
        
        3.1beta1 (2012-12-21)
        =====================
        
        Features added
        --------------
        
        * New build-time option ``--with-unicode-strings`` for Python 2 that
          makes the API always return Unicode strings for names and text
          instead of byte strings for plain ASCII content.
        
        * New incremental XML file writing API ``etree.xmlfile()``.
        
        * E factory in lxml.objectify is callable to simplify the creation of
          tags with non-identifier names without having to resort to getattr().
        
        Bugs fixed
        ----------
        
        * When starting from a non-namespaced element in lxml.objectify, searching
          for a child without explicitly specifying a namespace incorrectly found
          namespaced elements with the requested local name, instead of restricting
          the search to non-namespaced children.
        
        * GH#85: Deprecation warnings were fixed for Python 3.x.
        
        * GH#33: lxml.html.fromstring() failed to accept bytes input in Py3.
        
        * LP#1080792: Static build of libxml2 2.9.0 failed due to missing file.
        
        Other changes
        -------------
        
        * The externally useless class ``_ObjectifyElementMakerCaller`` was
          removed from the module API of lxml.objectify.
        
        * LP#1075622: lxml.builder is faster for adding text to elements with
          many children.  Patch by Anders Hammarquist.
